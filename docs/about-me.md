I have found joy in advancing the vision of enabling an understanding of biology at the proteoform level, peering into the cellular machinery in a way that reveals precisely which molecule is acting in the biological system. Recently, I have been working in Emma Lundberg’s lab on understanding how the expression of these molecules varies between individual cells in space and time. Emma Lundberg’s group has a wealth of experience in using microscopy to yield biological images that paint a picture of this cell-to-cell heterogeneity of protein expression information, and joining her lab has deepened my expertise in integrating datasets to perform innovative analyses of single-cell protein expression. I hope to extend this towards analyzing single-cell proteoform expression, understanding the heterogeneity and flux between these proteoforms in space and time, and digging into the fundamental insights about human biology these data may reveal.
