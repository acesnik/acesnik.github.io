The central goal of my pedagogy is to inspire life­long learning. This type of self-­efficacy is challenging to foster, especially in large courses that are evaluated on the basis of assignment and exam grades. Motivated students can find themselves dedicated to the achievement of high grades, rather than deep curiosity and knowledge integration. I am dedicated to learning and applying the methods that best achieve this goal in current grading systems and researching new methods to possibly push our abilities to best inspire inquisitive minds further.

## Mentoring
My philosophy for mentorship ties back to my teaching philosophy, with an emphasis on creating self-­efficacy and a love of life­long learning and scientific inquiry. I aim to give guidance that avoids mi­cromanagement and seeks to explore the greater questions and insights of experiments. For graduate mentees, I guide shaping research projects to be important, concrete, and feasible, and once they are underway, I support them in identifying issues and troubleshooting how to accomplish the project, write a paper, and publish. I have not yet mentored any postdoctoral trainees, but I anticipate they will be many steps further in the direction of in­ dependence than graduate mentees and that the speed of this process of idea generation, experimentation, and publishing will be faster. For undergraduate mentees, I focus first on designing experiments with them that are aimed at yielding early successes and insights into an existing question. Overall, I aim for a balanced and involved mentorship style that fosters self­efficacy, enthusiasm, and scientific inquiry.

## Teaching Training
_Postdoctoral Teaching Certificate_, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA 2022 – 2023
  * Completed 100 hours of core teaching training, journal clubs for pedagogy research, and teaching practice.

_GradCDI_, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA 2023
  * Week­long course design bootcamp titled, “Course Design Institute for Graduate Students and Postdoctoral Scholars.” 
  * Began designing graduate-­level course titled, “Deciphering protein variation with proteogenomics.”

_edX: Advancing Learning Through Evidence-­Based STEM Teaching_, CIRTL, UW­-Madison 2023
  * Month­long online pedagogy course focused on teaching­as research, learning communities, and learning through diversity. **Completed with distinction.**

## Teaching experience

I have been involved in higher education since 2009, including around 1,300 hours of teaching, preparation, and training. The bulk of my teaching experience was between 2012-­2014 as a teaching assistant for four semesters of undergraduate chemistry courses and one graduate level course. Over the course of these educational experiences, which totaled approximately 1,200 hours, I taught mini­lectures preparing stu­ dents for laboratory sections, prepared and graded worksheets, and worked one­on­one with the learning needs of dozens of students each semester. During my postdoctoral studies, I have maintained a continued interest in pedagogy and including completing the Stanford Postdoctoral Teaching Certificate in 2022-­2023 that guided over 100 hours of core teaching training, journal clubs for pedagogy research, and teaching practice.
