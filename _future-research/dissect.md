<!-- ## Area 1: Revealing proteoform families under­lying cellular processes and diseases. -->
Proteins are involved in nearly every biological process, and there is widespread variation in pro­tein expression between cells and within cel­lular substructures. However, the proteoforms underlying this extensive proteomic heterogene­ity are largely unknown. We will collect mass spectrometry-­based proteomic data to answer how proteoform variation changes over cellular division to better understand proteoform variation in cancer.
