<!-- ## Area 3: Discerning proteoform function with spatial proteomics.  -->
Spatial variations in protein expression within cells are widespread and can allow proteins to have multiple functions. We will garner experimental evi­dence of such functional proteoform variation by collecting and integrating both microscopy­ and mass spectrometry­ based proteomic datasets for site­specific modified proteoforms. We will combine these two data modalities to build a data-­driven map of proteoform localizations, interactions, and functions at all levels of cellular organization. This will enable broad usage of these data to better understand proteoform variation in human health.
